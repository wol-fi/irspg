# Spectral Projected Gradient with Inexact Restoration
An algorithm for large-scale optimization with non-convex constraints, based on the Spectral Projected Gradient method with Inexact Restoration (IR-SPG). The method is highly efficient when projections on the constraints are of low computaional effort. It allows to handle equality and inequality constraints simultaneously.
